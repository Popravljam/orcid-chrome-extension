## Technical Details

### ORCID ID Detection
- Uses robust regex patterns to match various ORCID ID formats
- Processes both static and dynamic content
- Handles single-page applications with mutation observers
- Avoids duplicate processing for performance

### API Integration
- Uses ORCID's public API (no authentication required)
- Fetches profile data in real-time
- Caches responses to avoid duplicate API calls
- Handles API errors gracefully

### Privacy & Security

**100% Privacy-Friendly - Zero Data Collection**

This extension is designed with your privacy as the top priority:

- **No data collection**: Extension doesn't collect, store, or transmit ANY personal data
- **No remote servers**: We don't operate any servers - no data is sent to us
- **Local processing only**: All ORCID ID detection happens locally in your browser
- **No tracking**: Zero analytics, no usage statistics, no behavior tracking
- **No cookies**: No tracking cookies or persistent identifiers
- **Public API only**: Only accesses publicly available ORCID information via direct API calls
- **You're in control**: API calls only happen when YOU click on an ORCID ID
- **Memory-only cache**: Temporary caching in browser memory only, cleared when you close the browser
- **Open source**: All code is visible and auditable

**The ONLY external communication** is direct API calls from your browser to ORCID's public API (pub.orcid.org) when you explicitly click on an ORCID ID. These calls retrieve publicly available researcher information.

See our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for complete details.
